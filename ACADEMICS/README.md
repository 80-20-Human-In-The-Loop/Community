# Welcome Academics

This is your hub for all things Academia!

I like to collect research papers that I think are important for our mission.
They are directly related to managing Open Source Communities, and covers topics such as efficiency, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and more.

## The Folder Structure

Each Paper I like (feel free to suggest some!) Will have a downloaded PDF copy, a link to find online, and the opportunity for any community member to create "Essays", based on the contents of that paper.

If you enjoy writing philosophical/technical Essays on Academic Research, then this is the place for you!

The Essays we write here will be used in discussions within this community, and perhaps even make it's way into the core philosophy of our Organization.
