# The Constitution of the 80-20 Human in The Loop Community
*A Democratic Experiment in Preserving Human Agency While using AI Responsibly*

This is my first proposal! I need three signatories, ideally one from each field covered by the three comittees (Technical, Humanities, & People's)

## Preamble

We are developers, teachers, thinkers, and users united by a growing alarm: we are building systems we don't understand, using tools that make us dumber, and calling it progress.

This community exists to prove there's another way. Technology should amplify human capability, not replace it. AI should handle the repetitive so humans can focus on the creative, the ethical, the meaningful. 

We believe in three irreplaceable human values that no algorithm can replicate: **Wisdom** (understanding consequences beyond data), **Integrity** (taking responsibility for what we build), and **Compassion** (caring about human flourishing over metrics).

These aren't abstract ideals. They're practical necessities. When systems fail—and they always do—we need humans who understand why, who can fix them, who remember what the code was supposed to do for people.

This constitution isn't perfect. It's an experiment in building technology communities that don't eat their own souls.

Join us if you believe humans matter more than metrics.

## Article I: The Sacred Principles
*These cannot be changed, even by unanimous vote*

**1. The 80-20 Philosophy is Non-Negotiable**
80% automation, 20% human oversight, 100% human responsibility. This ratio is flexible in practice but immutable in principle.

**2. All Tools Remain Open Source**
Knowledge wants to be free. Our tools will never be closed, sold, or locked behind paywalls. If we build it together, we share it together.

**3. Education Over Efficiency**
Every tool we build must teach something. A tool that makes you faster but dumber is a tool we don't build.

**4. The Three Committees Always Exist**
Technical, Humanities, and People's committees each hold 1/3 of collective power. No committee can be dissolved, diminished, or dominated.

**5. Human Values Over Metrics**
Wisdom, Integrity, and Compassion remain our core values. When metrics conflict with values, values win.

## Article II: The Structure of Power
*How we organize without becoming what we resist*

**1. The Benevolent Leader (For Now)**
The Leader retains 20% reserve power - enough to break deadlocks and prevent catastrophe, not enough to rule unilaterally. This power exists to serve the community, not control it.

**2. Three Equal Committees**
- **Technical Committee**: Those who build, break, and understand systems
- **Humanities Committee**: Those who question why and what it means
- **People's Committee**: Those who use and live with what we build

Each member self-selects their committee. No gatekeeping, no entrance exams. You know where you belong better than we do.

**3. Committee Structure and Representation**

**The Spokesperson Role:**
- Each committee elects a spokesperson annually (during campaign season)
- The spokesperson is NOT the boss - they're the voice, not the brain
- Responsibilities: Present committee decisions, facilitate inter-committee communication, call committee meetings
- Can be recalled by 60% committee vote at any time
- Default selection: Person with most votes becomes spokesperson unless they decline

**Internal Committee Governance:**
Each committee must choose one of these structures within 30 days of formation:

a) **Direct Democracy Model**
   - Every decision goes to full committee vote
   - 51% decides normal committee business
   - 66% needed for committee positions on Normal Decisions
   - 75% needed for committee positions on Major Decisions

b) **Delegated Working Groups Model**
   - Committee creates 3-5 working groups for specific areas
   - Working groups have autonomy for their domain
   - Full committee votes only on cross-group issues
   - Each working group selects its own coordinator

c) **Rotating Council Model**
   - 5-person council elected quarterly from committee
   - Council makes day-to-day decisions
   - Full committee can override council with 60% vote
   - Council membership rotates - no consecutive terms

d) **Consensus Model (for the brave)**
   - All decisions require consensus minus one (one can stand aside)
   - If consensus fails after 3 meetings, falls back to 75% vote
   - Requires trained facilitator (committee provides training)

**4. Changing Committee Structure**
- Committees can change their governance model with 66% approval
- Must use current model for at least 6 months before changing
- Changes take effect at next campaign cycle

**5. Inter-Committee Relations**

**When Committees Disagree Internally:**
- Minority opinions can be submitted alongside majority decisions
- Any 30% of a committee can request Leader mediation
- If a committee is paralyzed for 30+ days, Leader can mandate temporary direct democracy

**When One Committee Feels Bulldozed:**
- Any committee can invoke "Stop and Explain" - pauses decision for 1 week
- Requesting committee must articulate specific concerns
- Other committees must address concerns before proceeding
- Can only be used once per decision

**6. The Reality Check Clause**
If a committee has fewer than 5 members, it automatically operates in Direct Democracy mode.

**7. Committee Communication & Coordination**

**Public Spaces (Where Democracy Happens):**
- **GitHub Discussions**: Official proposals, decisions, and community-wide discussions
  - Categories: [TECH], [HUMANITIES], [PEOPLE], [GENERAL], [CONSTITUTIONAL]
  - Anyone can read and comment
  - Committee members use tags to identify their committee when speaking officially
  - Proposals use templates: "Committee: X | Type: Minor/Normal/Major | Title"

**Working Spaces (Where Committees Get Stuff Done):**
- Each committee chooses its own tools (Discord, Slack, Matrix, carrier pigeon)
- Must be free and accessible to all committee members
- New members get invited during onboarding
- Not secret cabals - just spaces to hash out ideas before going public

**The Communication Flow:**
1. **Internal Discussion** → Committee debates privately, figures out their position
2. **Public Proposal** → Committee posts their official position on GitHub Discussions
3. **Community Feedback** → Everyone can comment, suggest, object
4. **Final Decision** → Based on decision type (Minor/Normal/Major), appropriate committees vote
5. **Implementation** → Decision logged, action taken, everyone knows what happened

**Transparency Requirements:**
- All official decisions must be posted publicly
- Private discussions are fine, but decisions must include:
  - What was decided
  - Why it was decided
  - Who disagreed and why (minority opinions welcome)
  - What happens next
- No "we decided in private and you'll never know why"

**Committee Identification:**
- GitHub Discussion posts should start with [TECH], [HUM], or [PEOPLE] when speaking as committee
- Committee spokespersons get a special tag/flair
- Individual members can speak personally without committee tags
- Clear difference between "I think" and "Our committee thinks"

**The Anti-Bureaucracy Clause:**
If this feels like too much process, it probably is. Committees can operate however they want as long as:
- Decisions are public
- People know how to participate
- Other committees can provide input
- Nobody's gatekeeping

**Emergency Communications:**
- Any committee member can post an [URGENT] thread
- Leader monitors these and can fast-track decisions
- For true emergencies (site down, security breach), act first, document later

## Article III: How Decisions Happen
*Democracy is slow but that's a feature, not a bug*

**1. Minor Decisions (One Committee Decides)**
- Changes that affect mainly one domain
- Reversible within 30 days
- No Budget Impact
- Must survive a 48-hour comment period where other committees can object
- **Gaming Prevention**: If ANY committee member believes this is miscategorized, it automatically escalates to Normal

**2. Normal Decisions (Two Committees Agree)**
- Cross-functional changes
- New tools or significant features
- Minimal Buget Impact
- Partnerships with other communities
- **Gaming Prevention**: If 5+ members from any committee object to categorization, it escalates to Major

**3. Major Decisions (All Three Committees or Two + Leader)**
- Constitutional amendments (except Sacred Principles)
- Major Budget Impact
- Fundamental direction changes
- Removing members
- Accepting corporate sponsorship
- Taking official political stances

**4. The Anti-Gaming Provisions**

**The Slicing Defense:**
- You cannot split one decision into multiple smaller ones to avoid scrutiny
- Example: Ten $99 purchases for the same project = one $990 Normal Decision
- If committees notice pattern splitting, all related decisions combine retroactively

**The Vagueness Trap:**
- Proposals must be specific enough that someone could implement them
- "Improve community tools" is not a proposal
- "Add authentication to Storm Checker using JWT" is a proposal
- Vague proposals get sent back for clarification, not voted on

**The Precedent Shield:**
- "We did this before" only applies if circumstances haven't materially changed
- Past bad decisions don't justify future bad decisions
- Each proposal stands on its own merits

**The Retrospective Escalation:**
- If a Minor decision turns out to affect other committees significantly, they can retroactively challenge it
- Requires showing actual harm or substantial unexpected impact
- Leader adjudicates if the escalation is valid

**The Good Faith Assumption (With Teeth):**
- First miscategorization: Assume honest mistake, educate on categories
- Second miscategorization: Public warning, extra scrutiny on future proposals
- Third miscategorization: One-year ban from making proposals (can still vote)
- Patterns of gaming = potential removal from community

**5. Decision Categories - The Real Test**

**Ask These Questions:**
1. Could this break something for another committee? → Not Minor
2. Does this cost real money or significant time? → Not Minor  
3. Would this change how new members experience our community? → At least Normal

**Examples:**

*Obviously Minor:*
- Updating documentation typos
- Choosing a new code formatter
- Scheduling a committee meeting

*Obviously Normal:*
- Adding a new dependency to core tools
- Creating a new community event
- Changing how we onboard members
- Any partnership, period

*Obviously Major:*
- Anything involving corporate money
- Anything that could get us sued
- Anything that changes our core philosophy
- Anything you're hoping people won't notice

**6. The Nuclear Option**
If committees deadlock for 60+ days on critical issues, Leader can call a general assembly where every member votes directly.

**Nuclear Option Safeguards:**
- Must document all attempted resolutions first
- Must show why delay causes active harm
- Cannot be used for convenience or impatience
- Assembly decision is final - no re-litigation for 1 year
- Can only be invoked twice per year maximum

**7. The Recursive Check**
Every decision, regardless of level, must answer:
- Are we making this decision to avoid making harder decisions?
- Will we understand why we did this in 2 years?
- Is this the kind of cleverness that destroys communities?

**8. Appeal Process**
- Any 10 members can appeal a decision's categorization to the Leader
- Leader decision on categorization is final
- This is not about the decision itself, only its level
- Prevents both gaming down AND vindictive escalation

## Article IV: The Leader's Powers
*What my 20% actually means in practice*

**The Mathematical Reality:**
- Three committees collectively hold 80% of voting power
- Each committee has 26.67% (80% ÷ 3)
- Leader has 20% voting power
- Total: 100%

**How This Actually Works:**

**Minor Decisions:** 
- I have no role. One committee decides, period.
- I can comment like any member but my opinion carries no special weight

**Normal Decisions (Requires 53.34% to pass):**
- Need 2 of 3 committees (53.34%) - PASSES
- My 20% + 1 committee (46.67%) - FAILS (not enough)
- My 20% + 2 committees (73.34%) - PASSES (but why would I need to add my weight here?)
- I cannot force through Normal decisions with just one committee

**Major Decisions (Requires 66.67% to pass):**
- All 3 committees (80%) - PASSES regardless of my vote
- 2 committees + me (53.34% + 20% = 73.34%) - PASSES
- 1 committee + me (26.67% + 20% = 46.67%) - FAILS
- Effectively: I need at least 2 committees with me to pass Major decisions

**The Reality Check:**
- My 20% mainly matters for breaking deadlocks on Major decisions
- If all 3 committees agree on something, my opposition is irrelevant (80% beats my 20%)
- I'm a tiebreaker with weight, not a dictator

**Other Leader Powers (The Non-Voting Ones):**

**Tiebreaker Authority:**
- When 2 committees can't agree on Normal decisions
- My 20% tips the scale
- Must explain reasoning publicly

**Peace-Making Authority:**
- Can call "cooling off" periods when committees are fighting
- Can facilitate mediation between committees
- Cannot force outcomes, just process

**Emergency Powers:**
- 30-day temporary actions for true emergencies (security, legal threats)
- Must be retroactively approved by committees or reversed
- Using this frivolously = fast track to being voted out

**What I Explicitly Cannot Do:**
- Override unanimous committee agreement (they have 80%, I have 20%)
- Make Minor or Normal decisions unilaterally
- Change voting math or committee structure
- Prevent my own removal if committees agree
- Pretend math works differently than it does

## Article V: Campaign Cycles
*Democracy needs regular chances to change its mind*

**1. The Campaign Season**
- **When**: Every January 1st, the 90-day campaign season begins
- **Who Can Run**: ANYBODY. No gatekeeping, no prerequisites, no "you must be this technical to ride"
- **Application**: Simple form - Name, chosen committee, why you want to join (optional)
- **Campaign Style**: However you want - write manifestos, make memes, stay silent, whatever works
- **The Vote**: Happens April 1st (no joke), results announced same day

**2. How Voting Works**
- **Simple Ranked Choice**: List your top candidates for each committee
- **Who Votes**: Every current member votes for all committees (not just their own)
- **The Platform**: We'll build a simple Django app for this (because eating our own dogfood matters)
- **Transparency**: All vote tallies public after election

**3. Committee Sizing (The Fair Way)**
- **Minimum Viable**: Each committee needs at least 5 members to function
- **Natural Growth**: No maximum size - let committees grow based on interest
- **Proportional Power**: Whether a committee has 5 or 50 members, it still has 26.67% voting power
- **Internal Democracy**: Larger committees might need sub-groups, but that's their problem to solve

**4. The Membership Year**
- **Terms**: April 1 to March 31 (one full year)
- **Commitment**: You're in your chosen committee for the full year
- **No Committee Hopping**: Pick your lane and stay in it until next campaign
- **Resignation**: You can leave anytime, but can't switch committees mid-year

**5. Campaign Rules (Keep It Human)**
- **Be Honest**: Promise only what you'll actually do
- **Be Respectful**: Attack ideas, not people
- **Be Transparent**: If you're running as a group/slate, say so
- **No Vote Buying**: Obviously
- **No Harassment**: Campaign FOR yourself, not AGAINST others

**6. Special Circumstances**

**If a Committee Falls Below 5:**
- Emergency recruitment period (30 days)
- If still under 5, committee functions merge temporarily to others
- Leader can make emergency appointments until next election

**Campaigning Ideas (Not Requirements):**
- Post your vision in GitHub Discussions
- Share what you've built/written/thought about
- Form slates with others who share your vision
- Or just put your name in and let your work speak for itself

**7. The Anti-Gaming Provisions**
- **No Sock Puppets**: One person, one vote, one membership
- **No Strategic Flooding**: Coordinating to game committee sizes = ban
- **No Quid Pro Quo**: "Vote for me and I'll vote for you" schemes = out
- **The Sniff Test**: If it feels slimy, it probably is

**8. Why This Matters**
Annual elections mean:
- Fresh energy and ideas
- Accountability (mess up and you're out next year)
- Opportunity (anyone can step up)
- Evolution (the community can change direction)

## Article VI: The Evolution Clause
*Even constitutions need version control*

**1. Leadership Accountability (The Democratic Sword)**

**Removing the Leader:**
- All 3 committees can vote to remove the leader through Major Decision framework (80% total power)
- Vote of no confidence triggers immediate leadership race
- Ousted leader can run for re-election (if they have the guts)
- Removal vote has a 90 day cooldown (prevent constant coup attempts)

**The Leadership Race:**
- **Duration**: 30-day campaign period starts immediately after successful removal vote
- **Candidates**: ANYONE can run - committee members, random contributors, your cool aunt who codes
- **Campaigning**: Go wild - manifestos, vision documents, interpretive dance, whatever
- **The Vote**: Every member gets one vote (not weighted by committee)
- **Victory**: Simple plurality wins (most votes, not majority needed)
- **Powers**: Winner gets the same 20% voting weight the previous leader had

**Why This Matters:**
- Leader must actually serve the community or face removal
- Creates productive tension and accountability
- Prevents the 20% from becoming tyrannical
- Makes leadership about service, not power

**Leadership Transitions:**
- Outgoing leader must transfer all admin access within 48 hours
- Documentation of all ongoing decisions/discussions
- Public transition meeting to ensure continuity
- If outgoing leader goes rogue, committees can act without them

**2. Constitutional Amendments**

**What Can Be Added:**
Anything except Sacred Principles (Article I) can be amended through:
- Unanimous committee agreement (80% without leader), OR
- Two committees + Leader agreement (53.34% + 20% = 73.34%), OR  
- General assembly with 75% of all members

**Amendment Process:**
1. Proposal posted publicly with 14-day comment period
2. Proposer must address substantial concerns raised
3. Final version locked for vote
4. Voting period lasts 7 days
5. If passed, takes effect in 30 days (unless urgent)

**Version Control:**
- Every amendment gets a version number (always 1.n)
- Full history maintained in git

**3. The Fork Clause**

**When Forking Is Appropriate:**
- Irreconcilable philosophical differences
- Geographic/language community needs
- Experimental governance models
- When 30%+ of community wants fundamental change majority won't accept

**How to Fork:**
1. Announce intent with clear reasoning
2. 30-day discussion period for reconciliation attempts
3. If proceeding, fork gets:
   - All code (it's open source anyway)
   - Right to modify governance however they want
   - No claim to original community name/resources
   - Our blessing (seriously, this is healthy)

**The Good Fork Pledge:**
- We won't badmouth forks (they're exploring different paths)
- Forks won't claim to be the "real" community
- Knowledge sharing continues between forks
- Maybe we learn from each other

**Post-Fork Relations:**
- Annual "Fork Family Reunion" (optional) to share learnings
- Cross-fork PRs welcomed
- Compete on results, not rhetoric

The only failure is refusing to evolve when evolution is needed.

## Article VII: Rights and Responsibilities
*What we owe each other*

**1. Right to Understanding**
- Every member has the right to ask "why?" and receive a real answer
- "Because the AI said so" is never an acceptable answer
- "I don't know yet" is acceptable if followed by "let's figure it out"
- Code reviews must explain concepts, not just point out errors
- No gatekeeping knowledge behind jargon or assumed context

**2. Right to Dissent**
- Disagreement is not disloyalty
- Every decision can be questioned, especially unanimous ones
- Minority reports are encouraged and documented
- "This feels wrong" is a valid starting point for discussion
- You cannot be removed for disagreeing (only for how you disagree)

**3. Right to Fail**
- Everyone will break production eventually (it's a rite of passage)
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Post-mortems focus on systems, not blame
- "I fucked up" should be met with "how do we fix it?" not "get out"

**4. Right to Boundaries**
- This is a volunteer community, not a job
- "Not today." or "Now Now." are valid replies.
- Burnout is real - take breaks without guilt
- Life happens - committees understand absence

**5. Responsibility to Share Knowledge**
- If you know something, teach it
- Write docs for the next person
- Answer questions without condescension
- Your clever hack needs comments explaining why it's clever

**6. Responsibility to Own Your Shit**
- When your code breaks production, own it
- When your decision was wrong, admit it
- When you were an asshole, apologize
- When you don't understand, ask
- Delete your ego or it will delete you

**7. Responsibility to Build Up, Not Tear Down**
- Critique code, not coders
- Suggest improvements, not just problems
- If you hate something, help fix it
- Cynicism without contribution is just noise

**8. Right to Recognition**
- Credit for ideas belongs to their creators
- Contributors get named, not anonymized
- Small contributions matter and get acknowledged

**9. Responsibility to Reality**
- We build for actual users, not hypothetical ones
- We test on real constraints, not ideal conditions
- We acknowledge when things aren't working
- We measure impact, not just intention

**10. The Sacred Right to Call Bullshit**
- Anyone can call out when we're doing things just for show (theater)
- Anyone can call out when we're copying practices without understanding why (cargo-culting)
- Anyone can point out when we're creating bureaucracy that doesn't help anyone
- "This is becoming recursive absurd" = we're creating complexity that serves no purpose
- If a meeting could have been a GitHub comment, say so

**11. The Non-Negotiable Responsibilities**
- No harassment. Period. First offense = warning. Second = removal.
- No discrimination. Your biases are your problem to fix.
- No exploitation. We're building tools for developers, not free labor for your startup.
- No surveillance. Don't track users without explicit consent.

**12. The Community Protection Clause**

**What We Mean By Harmful Behavior:**
- **Harassment**: Repeated unwanted contact, personal attacks, doxxing, threats
- **Bad-faith argumentation**: Deliberately misrepresenting others' positions, demanding endless proof while providing none, derailing conversations
- **Discrimination**: Treating people differently based on identity rather than actions
- **Exploitation**: Using community resources/labor for personal profit without consent
- **Toxic patterns**: Consistently negative, draining community energy, making everything about themselves

**The Process (Because Due Process Matters):**
1. **First incident**: Private message from committee spokesperson explaining the problem
2. **Second incident**: Public warning and temporary suspension from discussions (7 days)
3. **Third incident**: Removal vote by committees (handled as Major Decision)

**Immediate Removal (Some Things Are Unforgivable):**
- Doxxing or threatening members
- Sexual Harrassment
- Hate speech or discriminatory attacks
- Malicious code intended to harm users
- Illegal activity using community resources

**The Investigation Process:**
- Accused person gets to provide their perspective
- Multiple committee members review evidence
- Decision documented with reasoning
- Appeals possible through leadership

**Protecting the Accused Too:**
- False accusations are also harmful behavior
- Disagreement alone is never grounds for removal
- Technical criticism is not harassment
- Being annoying is not the same as being harmful

**The Gray Areas:**
Sometimes behavior isn't clearly harmful but definitely isn't helpful. For these cases:
- First try education: "Hey, this is how we do things here"
- If pattern continues: "This isn't working out"
- Mutual parting possible: "Maybe this isn't the right community for you"

**The Spirit of This Clause:**
We're not trying to create a police state. We're trying to keep a space where people can build, learn, and grow without abuse. Most people never need this clause. But when someone is genuinely harmful, we need clear ways to protect everyone else.

## Article VIII: The Recursive Absurd Check
*Our philosophical immune system*

**The Core Recognition:**
We are building systems that build systems that build us. Without conscious intervention, we become prisoners of our own code, optimizing meaningless metrics while forgetting what problems we originally meant to solve.

**Every Decision Must Pass This Filter:**

**1. The Understanding Test**
- Can you explain this to someone who doesn't code?
- Will you understand this decision in 2 years?
- Could a new member understand why we did this?
- If the answer is "the AI said so" or "it's industry standard," it fails

**2. The Meaning Test**
- What actual human problem does this solve?
- Are we solving a real problem or creating problems to solve?
- Is this genuinely useful or just technically impressive?
- Would this matter if all the computers disappeared tomorrow?

**3. The Agency Test**
- Does this increase human capability or dependence?
- Are we building tools or becoming tools?
- Can humans override, understand, and improve this?
- Who's really in control—us or the system?

**The Solidarity Clause:**

The recursive absurd thrives on isolation—alone, we can't see the systems we're trapped in. Together, we can call out absurdity before it becomes normal. This check isn't individual judgment but collective recognition.

**Why We Named It:**

Naming the recursive absurd gives us power over it. Like debugging, you can't fix what you can't identify. By explicitly checking for it, we make it visible, discussable, defeatable.

**Remember:**
We're not Luddites rejecting technology. We're engineers refusing to become our own tools. We're builders who insist on understanding what we build. We're humans who remember that technology should amplify humanity, not replace it.

Every line of code is a choice. Every system is a philosophy. Every tool shapes its users.

Choose wisely. Build consciously. Stay human.

## Article IX: Emergency Protocols
*When everything is on fire*

**1. Security Breaches**
Leader can act immediately, committees review within 72 hours.

**2. Cascading System Failures**
Any committee member can pull the emergency brake. Better to break things than pretend they work.

**3. Community Crisis**
If we're tearing ourselves apart, any 10 members can call for a cooling-off period where all decisions pause for one week.

## Article X: The Human Clause
*Why we're really here*

We're not building a coding organization. We're building a community of humans who happen to code. The difference matters.

When this constitution conflicts with human decency, decency wins.
When efficiency conflicts with compassion, compassion wins.
When metrics conflict with meaning, meaning wins.

We're here to prove that technology can amplify humanity instead of replacing it. That's not naive—it's necessary.
