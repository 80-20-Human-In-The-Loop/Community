# The Constitution of the 80-20 Human in The Loop Community
*A Democratic Experiment in Preserving Human Agency While using AI Responsibly*

This is my first proposal! I need three signatories, ideally one from each field covered by the three comittees (Technical, Humanities, & People's)

To sign this, you simply have to read the document, and agree with it. If you disagree with it to the point where you would like to see some changes, make a [Github Discussion Post under 'Constitution Concern'](https://github.com/orgs/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/discussions/new?category=constitution-concern). We'd rather hash it out here than have you reluctantly sign something you don't actually support.

This may read as paranoid about corporate capture. That's because we've watched it happen to project after project. We'd rather be overly cautious than naive.

## Preamble

We are developers, teachers, thinkers, and users caught in a trap we built ourselves. United by a growing alarm: we are building systems we don't understand, using tools that make us dumber, and calling it progress.

This community exists to prove there's another way. Technology should amplify human capability, not replace it. AI should handle the mindless repetitive crap so humans can focus on the creative, the ethical, the meaningful; the work that reminds us why we started coding in the first place.

We believe in three irreplaceable human values that no algorithm can replicate: **Wisdom** (understanding consequences beyond data), **Integrity** (taking responsibility for what we build), and **Compassion** (caring about human flourishing over metrics).

These aren't just nice words we put in our constitution to feel good about ourselves. They're the difference between tools that serve humans and tools that consume them. When systems fail—and they always do—we need humans who understand why, who can fix them, who remember what the code was supposed to do for people.

This constitution is an experiment in building technology communities that don't get their souls eaten. Could a corporation adopt this constitution? Absolutely fucking not. The language alone would cause the entire HR department to shit their pants. That's the point. This constitution is corporate-repellent by design.

Join us if you believe humans matter more than metrics.

## Article I: The Sacred Principles
*These cannot be changed, even by unanimous vote*

**1. The 80-20 Philosophy is Non-Negotiable**
80% automation, 20% human oversight, 100% human responsibility. This ratio is flexible in practice but immutable in principle.

**2. All Tools Remain Open Source**
Knowledge wants to be free. Our tools will never be closed, sold, or locked behind paywalls. If we build it together, we share it together.

**3. Education Over Efficiency**
Every tool we build must teach something. A tool that makes you faster but dumber is a tool we don't build.

**4. The Three Committees Always Exist**
Technical, Humanities, and People's committees each hold 1/3 of collective power. No committee can be dissolved, diminished, or dominated.

**5. Human Values Over Metrics**
Wisdom, Integrity, and Compassion remain our core values. When metrics conflict with values, values win.

## Article II: The Structure of Power
*How we organize without becoming what we resist*

**1. The Benevolent Leader (For Now)**
The Leader retains 20% reserve power - enough to break deadlocks and prevent catastrophe, not enough to rule unilaterally. This power exists to serve the community, not control it.

**2. Three Equal Committees**
- **Technical Committee**: Those who build, break, and understand systems
- **Humanities Committee**: Those who question why and what it means
- **People's Committee**: Those who use and live with what we build

Each member self-selects their committee. No gatekeeping, no entrance exams. You know where you belong better than we do.

**3. How Committees Work**

If a committee can't decide on their internal decision-making structure within 30 days of the new committee year (by May 1st), they default to direct democracy mode for the remainder of that year: every member votes, 51% wins.

Each committee picks a spokesperson annually - they're the voice, not the boss. Can be recalled by 60% committee vote anytime.

If a committee drops below 3 members at any point during the year, it ceases to function as an independent committee. Within 7 days, its remaining members must choose to join one of the other two committees for the remainder of that committee year. Members should split roughly 50/50 between the remaining committees when possible, but ultimately each person chooses where they go.

**4. Committee Communication & Coordination**

**The Anti-Bureaucracy Clause:**
Committees can operate however they want as long as:
- Decisions are public
- People know how to participate
- Other committees can provide input
- Nobody's gatekeeping
- No bullshit theater just to look "professional"

**Public Spaces (Where Democracy Happens):**
- **GitHub Discussions**: Official proposals, decisions, and community-wide discussions
  - Categories: [TECH], [HUMANITIES], [PEOPLE], [GENERAL], [CONSTITUTIONAL]
  - Anyone can read and comment
  - Committee members use tags to identify their committee when speaking officially
  - Proposals use templates: "Committee: X | Type: Minor/Normal/Major | Title"

**Working Spaces (Where Committees Get Stuff Done):**
- Each committee chooses its own tools (Discord, Slack, Matrix, carrier pigeon)
- Must be free and accessible to all committee members
- New members get invited during onboarding
- Not secret cabals - just spaces to hash out ideas before going public

**Transparency**
Committees organize and communicate however they want. All decisions must be posted publicly on GitHub with:
- What was decided
- Why it was decided  
- What happens next

That's it. No secret decisions.

## Article III: How Decisions Happen
*Democracy is slow but that's a feature, not a bug*

**1. Minor Decisions (One Committee Decides)**
- Changes that affect mainly one domain
- Reversible within 30 days
- No Budget Impact
- Must survive a 48-hour comment period where other committees can object
- **Gaming Prevention**: If ANY committee member believes this is miscategorized, it automatically escalates to Normal

**2. Normal Decisions (Two Committees Agree)**
- Cross-functional changes
- New tools or significant features
- Minimal Budget Impact
- Partnerships with other communities
- **Gaming Prevention**: If 5+ members from any committee object to categorization, it escalates to Major

**3. Major Decisions (All Three Committees or Two + Leader)**
- Constitutional amendments (except Sacred Principles)
- Major Budget Impact
- Fundamental direction changes
- Removing members
- Accepting corporate sponsorship
- Taking official political stances
- Corporate buyout (lol absolutely fucking not)

**4. Don't Game the System**

- Can't split one big decision into many small ones to avoid scrutiny
- Proposals must be specific enough to implement
- If you try to game the system, we'll call you out and potentially vote you out
- Don't be an asshole

**5. Decision Categories - The Real Test**

**Ask These Questions:**
1. Could this break something for another committee? → Not Minor
2. Does this cost real money or significant time? → Not Minor  
3. Would this change how new members experience our community? → At least Normal

**Examples:**

*Obviously Minor:*
- Updating documentation typos
- Choosing a new code formatter
- Scheduling a committee meeting

*Obviously Normal:*
- Adding a new dependency to core tools
- Creating a new community event
- Changing how we onboard members
- Any partnership, period

*Obviously Major:*
- Anything involving corporate money
- Anything that could get us sued
- Anything that changes our core philosophy
- Anything you're hoping people won't notice (we will notice)

**6. Breaking Deadlocks**
If committees deadlock for 60+ days on something critical, the Leader can call a general assembly where every member votes directly.

**7. The Recursive Absurd Check**
Every decision, regardless of level, must answer:
- Are we making this decision to avoid making harder decisions?
- Will we understand why we did this in 2 years?
- Is this the kind of cleverness that destroys communities?

**8. Appeal Process**
- Any 10 members can appeal a decision's categorization to the Leader
- Leader decision on categorization is final
- This is not about the decision itself, only its level
- Prevents both gaming down AND vindictive escalation

## Article IV: The Leader's Powers
*What my 20% actually means in practice*

**The Mathematical Reality:**
- Three committees collectively hold 80% of voting power
- Each committee has 26.67% (80% ÷ 3)
- Leader has 20% voting power
- Total: 100%

**How This Actually Works:**

**Minor Decisions:** 
- I have no role. One committee decides, period.
- I can comment like any member but my opinion carries no special weight

**Normal Decisions (Requires 53.34% to pass):**
- Need 2 of 3 committees (53.34%) - PASSES
- My 20% + 1 committee (46.67%) - FAILS (not enough)
- My 20% + 2 committees (73.34%) - PASSES (but why would I need to add my weight here?)
- I cannot force through Normal decisions with just one committee

**Major Decisions (Requires 66.67% to pass):**
- All 3 committees (80%) - PASSES regardless of my vote
- 2 committees + me (53.34% + 20% = 73.34%) - PASSES
- 1 committee + me (26.67% + 20% = 46.67%) - FAILS
- Effectively: I need at least 2 committees with me to pass Major decisions

**The Reality Check:**
- My 20% mainly matters for breaking deadlocks on Major decisions
- If all 3 committees agree on something, my opposition is irrelevant (80% beats my 20%)
- I'm a tiebreaker with weight, not a dictator

**Other Leader Powers (The Non-Voting Ones):**

**Tiebreaker Authority:**
- When 2 committees can't agree on Normal decisions
- My 20% tips the scale
- Must explain reasoning publicly

**Peace-Making Authority:**
- Can call "cooling off" periods when committees are fighting
- Can facilitate mediation between committees
- Cannot force outcomes, just process

**Emergency Powers:**
- 30-day temporary actions for true emergencies (security, legal threats)
- Must be retroactively approved by committees or reversed
- Using this frivolously = fast track to being voted out

**What I Explicitly Cannot Do:**
- Override unanimous committee agreement (they have 80%, I have 20%)
- Make Minor or Normal decisions unilaterally
- Change voting math or committee structure
- Prevent my own removal if committees agree
- Pretend math works differently than it does

## Article V: Membership
*Simple and clear*

**Annual Membership**
- Every January, people say what committee they want to join
- Current members can stay or switch committees  
- New people can apply - just say who you are and why you're interested
- Committee membership runs April 1 to March 31
- We'll figure out a simple way to vote if more people want in than we can handle

**The Basics**
- One person, one committee, one year commitment
- Committees need at least 5 members to function
- No maximum size - let committees grow naturally
- Each committee still has 26.67% voting power regardless of size
  
## Article VI: The Evolution Clause
*Even constitutions need version control*

**1. Leadership Accountability (The Democratic Sword)**

**Removing the Leader:**
- All 3 committees can vote to remove the leader through Major Decision framework (80% total power)
- Vote of no confidence triggers immediate leadership race
- Ousted leader can run for re-election (if they have the guts)
- Removal vote has a 90 day cooldown (prevent constant coup attempts)

**The Leadership Race:**
- **Duration**: 30-day campaign period starts immediately after successful removal vote
- **Candidates**: ANYONE can run - committee members, random contributors, your cool aunt who codes
- **Campaigning**: Go wild - manifestos, vision documents, interpretive dance, whatever
- **The Vote**: Every member gets one vote (not weighted by committee)
- **Victory**: Simple plurality wins (most votes, not majority needed)
- **Powers**: Winner gets the same 20% voting weight the previous leader had

**Why This Matters:**
- Leader must actually serve the community or face removal
- Creates productive tension and accountability
- Prevents the 20% from becoming tyrannical
- Makes leadership about service, not power

**Leadership Transitions:**
- Outgoing leader must transfer all admin access within 48 hours
- Documentation of all ongoing decisions/discussions
- Public transition meeting to ensure continuity
- If outgoing leader goes rogue, committees can act without them

**2. Constitutional Amendments**

**Amendment Process:**
Propose it publicly, discuss it openly, vote on it. If it passes, it happens.

This always counts as a Major Decision (all 3 committees agree, or 2 committees + leader)

**Version Control:**
- Every amendment gets a version number (always 1.n)
- Full history maintained in git

**3. The Fork Clause**

Sometimes shit doesn't work out. That's fine. Fork it.

**When Forking Is Appropriate:**
- Irreconcilable philosophical differences
- Geographic/language community needs
- Experimental governance models
- When 30%+ of community wants fundamental change majority won't accept

**How to Fork:**
1. Announce intent with clear reasoning
2. 30-day discussion period for reconciliation attempts
3. If proceeding, fork gets:
   - All code (it's open source anyway)
   - Right to modify governance however they want
   - No claim to original community name/resources
   - Our blessing (seriously, this is healthy)

**The Good Fork Pledge:**
- We won't badmouth forks (they're exploring different paths)
- Forks won't claim to be the "real" community
- Knowledge sharing continues between forks
- Maybe we learn from each other

**Post-Fork Relations:**
- Annual "Fork Family Reunion" (optional) to share learnings
- Cross-fork PRs welcomed
- Compete on results, not rhetoric

The only failure is refusing to evolve when evolution is needed.

## Article VII: Rights and Responsibilities
*What we owe each other*

**1. Right to Understanding**
- Every member has the right to ask "why?" and receive a real answer
- "Because the AI said so" is never an acceptable answer
- "I don't know yet" is acceptable if followed by "let's figure it out"
- Code reviews must explain concepts, not just point out errors
- No gatekeeping knowledge behind jargon or assumed context

**2. Right to Dissent**
- Disagreement is not disloyalty
- Every decision can be questioned, especially unanimous ones
- Minority reports are encouraged and documented
- "This feels wrong" is a valid starting point for discussion
- You cannot be removed for disagreeing (only for how you disagree)

**3. Right to Fail**
- Everyone will break production eventually (it's a rite of passage)
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Post-mortems focus on systems, not blame
- "I fucked up" should be met with "how do we fix it?" not "get out"

**4. Right to Boundaries**
- This is a volunteer community, not a job
- "Not today." or "Not now." are valid replies.
- Burnout is real - take breaks without guilt
- Life happens - committees understand absence

**5. Responsibility to Share Knowledge**
- If you know something, teach it
- Write docs for the next person
- Answer questions without condescension
- Your clever hack needs comments explaining why it's clever

**6. Responsibility to Own Your Shit**
- When your code breaks production, own it
- When your decision was wrong, admit it
- When you were an asshole, apologize
- When you don't understand, ask
- Delete your ego or it will delete you

**7. Responsibility to Build Up, Not Tear Down**
- Critique code, not coders
- Suggest improvements, not just problems
- If you hate something, help fix it
- Cynicism without contribution is just noise

**8. Right to Recognition**
- Credit for ideas belongs to their creators
- Contributors get named, not anonymized
- Small contributions matter and get acknowledged

**9. Responsibility to Reality**
- We build for actual users, not hypothetical ones
- We test on real constraints, not ideal conditions
- We acknowledge when things aren't working
- We measure impact, not just intention

**10. The Sacred Right to Call Bullshit**
- Anyone can call out when we're doing things just for show (theater)
- Anyone can call out when we're copying practices without understanding why (cargo-culting)
- Anyone can point out when we're creating bureaucracy that doesn't help anyone
- "This is becoming recursive absurd" = we're creating complexity that serves no purpose
- If a meeting could have been a GitHub comment, say so

**11. The Non-Negotiable Responsibilities**
- No harassment. Period. First offense = warning. Second = removal.
- No discrimination. Your biases are your problem to fix.
- No exploitation. We're building tools for humans, not free labor for your startup.
- No surveillance. Don't track users without explicit consent.

**12. The Community Protection Clause**

**What We Mean By Harmful Behavior:**
Don't harass, discriminate, exploit, or consistently drain community energy.

**The Simple Truth:**
Don't be an asshole. If you are, committees vote you out.

**Immediate Removal:**
Doxxing, threats, sexual harassment, hate speech, malicious code, illegal activity = instant removal.

**Remember:**
Technical criticism isn't harassment. Being annoying isn't being harmful. False accusations are also harmful behavior.

## Article VIII: The Recursive Absurd Check
*Our philosophical immune system*

**The Core Recognition:**
We are building systems that build systems that build us. Without conscious intervention, we become prisoners of our own bullshit, optimizing meaningless metrics while forgetting what problems we originally meant to solve.

**Every Decision Must Pass This Filter:**

**1. The Understanding Test**
- Can you explain this to someone who doesn't code?
- Will you understand this decision in 2 years?
- Could a new member understand why we did this?
- If the answer is "the AI said so" or "it's industry standard," it fails

**2. The Meaning Test**
- What actual human problem does this solve?
- Are we solving a real problem or creating problems to solve?
- Is this genuinely useful or just technically impressive?
- Would this matter if all the computers disappeared tomorrow?

**3. The Agency Test**
- Does this increase human capability or dependence?
- Are we building tools or becoming tools?
- Can humans override, understand, and improve this?
- Who's really in control—us or the system?

**The Solidarity Clause:**

The recursive absurd thrives on isolation—alone, we can't see the systems we're trapped in. Together, we can call out absurdity before it becomes normal. This check isn't individual judgment but collective recognition.

**Why We Named It:**

Naming the recursive absurd gives us power over it. Like debugging, you can't fix what you can't identify. By explicitly checking for it, we make it visible, discussable, defeatable.

**Remember:**
We're not Luddites rejecting technology. We're engineers refusing to become our own tools. We're builders who insist on understanding what we build. We're humans who remember that technology should amplify humanity, not replace it.

Every line of code is a choice. Every system is a philosophy. Every tool shapes its users.

Choose wisely. Build consciously. Stay human.

## Article IX: Emergency Protocols
*When everything is on fire*

**1. Security Breaches**
Leader can act immediately, committees review within 72 hours.

**2. Cascading System Failures**
Any committee member can pull the emergency brake. Better to break things than pretend they work.

**3. Community Crisis**
If we're tearing ourselves apart, any 10 members can call for a cooling-off period where all decisions pause for one week.

## Article X: The Human Clause
*Why we're really here*

We're here to prove that technology can amplify humanity instead of replacing it. That's not naive—it's necessary.

And if that sounds too idealistic, fuck it. We'd rather fail trying to stay human than succeed at becoming machines.
